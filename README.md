# Diablo-3-AHK-Auto-Salvage
This is a dynamic and true diablo 3 auto salvage script. You can also keep time and track your goblins per hour if needed

# Diablo 3 Asistant

Is an asistant to help with salvaging Legendary Items, Set Items, keeping track of all the Goblin and Rainbow Goblins you have found along with keeping track of how long you have farmed for, this is still a work in progress so there may be changes.

## Installation

1. Create a New Folder labeled anything you like.
2. Drop D3Assist.ahk into folder
3. Put Diablo 3 to Windowed (Fullscreen) mode. In game Press ESC --> Options --> Video --> Display --> Windowed (Fullscreen)
4. Upon start up some prompts will lead you through the set up process.
5. Third prompt will ask you to move you mouse to the Top Left corner of your inventory screen.
6. Fifth prompt will ask you to move you mouse to the Bottom Right corner of your inventory screen.
7. After setup initially the script will automatically know where the inventory is (as long as done correctly)
8. If by some chance the setup is botched and the inventory select is not correct, just delete the D3Assist.ini file in the folder you created in Step 1.
9. Profit
